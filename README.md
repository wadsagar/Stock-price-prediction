# Stock-price-prediction
In this project, I utilized historical stock price data for Apple Inc. obtained through the Yahoo Finance API. After performing exploratory data analysis and visualizing the stock price trends using Candlestick charts, I built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model using the Keras library to predict future stock prices. The model was trained on features such as the opening, high, low prices, and trading volume, aiming to predict the closing price. The LSTM architecture consisted of two layers with 128 and 64 units, respectively, followed by densely connected layers. The model was trained over 30 epochs using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss. The project concludes with making predictions for future stock prices based on a set of input features. This predictive model serves as a valuable tool for forecasting Apple's stock prices and gaining insights into potential market trends
